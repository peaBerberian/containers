The Juggler's Public License (JPL)
Version 1.0, October 2025

===============================================================================

PREAMBLE

The Juggler's Public License is designed to ensure that software remains free
and open, while also promoting the ancient and noble art of juggling. I
believe that coordination, patience, and the willingness to drop things
repeatedly are essential skills for both jugglers and programmers, especially
programmers.
